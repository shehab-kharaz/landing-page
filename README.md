# Landing Page Project

This project is a **fork** of the original [Landing Page project](https://github.com/udacity/cd0428-landing-page.git) from **Udacity**.

## Project Overview

The original project provided a static version of the Landing Page using basic HTML and CSS for styling. The task is to transform this static page into an **interactive landing page** by adding JavaScript functionality.

### What Need to be Done:
- Modify the existing **HTML** and **CSS** files as needed.
- Focus primarily on the **JavaScript** file to implement interactivity and dynamic functionality for the landing page.

## Repository Information
- **Original Repository**: [cd0428-landing-page](https://github.com/udacity/cd0428-landing-page.git) (Udacity’s repository)
- **Forked Repository**: This repository is a fork of the original Udacity project and is being worked on by **Shehab Kharaz**.

## Features Implemented

In addition to the base features of the static landing page, the following dynamic functionalities have been added:

1. **Dynamic Navbar**:
   - The navbar is created dynamically based on the sections available on the page. As the user scrolls, the relevant section is highlighted, and the corresponding navbar link is highlighted as well.
   - Each navbar link scrolls smoothly to its associated section when clicked, improving navigation.

2. **Section Activation**:
   - As the user scrolls through the page, the section in the viewport is activated (highlighted), and the respective navbar link is also highlighted.
   
3. **Scroll to Top Button**:
   - A "scroll to top" button appears when the user scrolls down more than 200 pixels. Clicking on this button smoothly scrolls the page back to the top, improving the user experience.

4. **Dynamic Header Visibility**:
   - The header hides as the user scrolls down and reappears when the user scrolls up or reaches near the top of the page. This feature ensures that the header remains visible when needed but does not take up screen space when the user is viewing content further down the page.

5. **Collapsible Sections**:
   - Sections on the page can be dynamically expanded or collapsed by clicking on the toggle button associated with each section. When expanded, the symbol changes to a minus sign (−), and when collapsed, it changes to a plus sign (+). This feature allows users to interact with sections to view additional content without overwhelming the page layout.

6. **Smooth Scrolling**:
   - All navigation actions, including the navbar links and scroll-to-top button, use smooth scrolling for a seamless experience. 


## Usage
  This project allows users to easily navigate through the sections of the landing page using the dynamically built navbar. When scrolling through the page, the active section is highlighted, and users can quickly return to the top of the page using the "scroll to top" button. The header will dynamically show or hide based on the user's scroll position, providing a clean user interface.
