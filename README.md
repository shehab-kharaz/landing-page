# Landing Page Project

This project is a **fork** of the original [Landing Page project](https://github.com/udacity/cd0428-landing-page.git) from **Udacity**.

## Project Overview

The original project provided a static version of the Landing Page using basic HTML and CSS for styling. The task is to transform this static page into an **interactive landing page** by adding JavaScript functionality. 

### What Need to be Done:
- Modify the existing **HTML** and **CSS** files as needed.
- Focus primarily on the **JavaScript** file to implement interactivity and dynamic functionality for the landing page.
